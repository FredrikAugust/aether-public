The source code made available as external components here are copyright their respective authors, and this license does not affect their licensing.

The frontend is under MIT license. You can find the frontend in GUI / WebKitApp. 

The backend license, which is temporary until I become confident with the app, is as follows. At the point I become comfortable, I am planning to GPLv2 it. 

* You can compile and package this in any way you want and use your unmodified copy. 

* If you modify in any way, you cannot use your modified copy to connect to the main network. Connecting two modified copies together etc. is fine.

* You cannot release your modified copy. Internal use on your own network is fine.

* You cannot use this code for any commercial purposes.

### Why?

Aether is less (much, *much* less) production ready than you think. If you are an user serious enough to be checking the license, you probably should **not** be using it. This is just an experiment, nothing more.
