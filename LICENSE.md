Backend (the rest) is a little bit thornier. I haven't had the time to think about this, so this is probably only a very temporary license, at some near point in time I am planning to convert this to an OSL-compatible one. In fact, this is so hastily drawn that there isn't even a license text, so I'll just state intent.
