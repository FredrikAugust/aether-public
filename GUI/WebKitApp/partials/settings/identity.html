            <p>You're an <em>unregistered user</em>, which means you are anonymous.</p>
            <p>You can pick anything you want. You can also change it any time. Names are not unique; someone else can take the same name as you.</p>
            <p>This also means you should not trust other users, as they might or might not be the people they say they are.</p>
            <p>You cannot edit or delete what you write, and it only goes away after 6 months. Be careful of what you say if you use a name indicative of your person.</p>
